## Introduction

This project was part of MKT 4325: International Marketing and Global Business Development I took during my undergraduate.

The “Global Organization” **[GO]**, a simulated global enterprise, is utilized to explore the global marketplace matching markets with the U.S.A. made or branded products. Global market teams are created to analyze, strategize, create business plans and present their findings to the Global Organization for consideration.

During the semester, we made two presentations which include two parts: *Product* and *Final Market Plan*. We were asked to find the Operation Mode or Products we would like to promote to another country, and research more about it. Our team chose Studio Movie Grill and we wanted to promote its operation mode to China.
